  text: "\tThe murders of Steven and Charley were no ordinary, the psychopath must've
    planned everything out months before the kidnapping. It had to be. There were
    no pieces of evidence in the park, the sidewalk, the swings, the seesaw. Only
    one thing stood out, the fact that no one in the vicinity of the park heard anything
    strange, the children followed the kidnapper without making a fuss as if they
    knew eachother well enough.\n\n\tThe boys' bodies were discovered by the police
    in the far back of a cemetery. Steven was found hanging off a branch, his lifeless
    body was pointing straight down \r\nto a marble cross which had engraved a name
    and a code: \r\n\"Charley Rollins\"\r\n\"Cabin x: <Cod>\""
