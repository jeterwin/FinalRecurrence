  text: "\tWe have exciting news, Happy Hearts Orphan Home is a new orphanage located
    on St. Philips street, which is greeted with booming success! The director wishes
    to create a wonderful place for the little children to call home and find an
    endearing and caring family to take care of them. The orphanage has a wide range
    of facilities, including a playground, a pool, and a small botanic garden where
    they learn how important plants and green life are for everyone! Last but not
    least, not long after the opening, two boys were adopted by two wonderful neighbouring
    families."
