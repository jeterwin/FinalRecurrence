  text: "\tThe iron gates concealed an immense, mist enwrapped oak forest. Tiny rays
    of pale light shone through the unnoticeable gaps between the dense trees. A
    lifeless smoke-pale cloud wrapped itself around your surroundings, it felt as
    if the forest was never-ending. It deadened sound, a somber silence overhung
    the ground, nothing stirred, nothing shone, nothing sang. Stormy weather spread
    twigs all over the uneven ground, some were munched by mud while others reached
    the lake close-by Cabin 7: 3047."
