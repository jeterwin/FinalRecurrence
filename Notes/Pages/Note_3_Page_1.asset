  text: "\tA transparent silhouette was rowing along the lake, waving towards the
    unknown. There is an unbearable putrid smell coming from the person paddling
    the canoe, everything that could seem off, did. The night already fell across
    the watery grey coulds, it was just a matter of time before the rain came in
    pouring, hovering the wide forest. No person would ever visit this gloomy place,
    be it day or night, moreover spend their life living in this lifeless, accursed
    woodland. Ironic enough, it felt as something alive was keeping its eyes locked
    onto you. With all these in mind, you are not alone. Mansion 1 : 2458."
