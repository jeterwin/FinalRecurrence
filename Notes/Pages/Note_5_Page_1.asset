  text: "\tLife gets a little boring without a bit of action in it. I can't remember
    the last time I felt so..empty. My head is filled with dreadful thoughts and
    no victims I can prey onto...That is until I saw a stray fox wandering around
    cluelessly. Catching it was the hard part, but haha, it was for sure enjoying
    every little moment, from the start where I gushed it's eyes out with my thumbs,
    to where it stopped breathing after there were no more limbs for me to rip off.
    My mind cleared up and everything fit together like some sort of puzzle, but
    oh, I remember now, He must be starving in my basement. Mansion 2: 8855."
