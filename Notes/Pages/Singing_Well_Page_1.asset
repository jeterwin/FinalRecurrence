  text: "\tThere were lots of primary school trips to this forest and all of them
    ended the same, with one tiny unfortunate event. Every child was joyful and full
    of excitement, there were many types of animals to be seen and the buildings
    gave off a distinguished vibe, which intrigued the little ones. It's said that
    there was a well, a well that sang a lullaby. The lullaby attracted one child,
    one child that decided, on his own, to depart from the group and adventure recklessly
    on his own. Little did he know that there was something evil about the well and
    no good will come out of this. \n\n\tThe only thing that remained, even to this
    day in the local newspapers, were the frighted and screaming faces of the teachers
    looking down at a floating body with a big smile on its face."
