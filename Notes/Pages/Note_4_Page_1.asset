  text: "\tDuring his childhood, being raised by some teenagers with no sense of
    responsibility, made him suffer alone, in silence. The constant seek of attention
    from people he saw as parents figures was often recognised by his neighbours.
    Everyday, after coming home from kindergarden, you could find him playing in
    the park with his 2 best friends. Time flew by, it was already evening. He usually
    wandered the streets alone, looking at the shiny lights coming from the neighbours'
    houses. Their shadows were mimicking happiness, fun family gatherings and long
    talks, these were all things that fascinated - and made him wander what living
    as someone else felt like. One sunny day, the postman rang the bell which immediately
    alarmed -. He rushed eagerly to the door just to be dissappointed. What was laying
    on the floor was a letter from an unknown sender, with little to no text written
    on it: \"Why would anyone build a tyrolean on their roof?..\""
