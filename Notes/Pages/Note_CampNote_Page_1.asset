  text: "\tMe and Gabriel already reached the camp site you're at and we left you
    some supplies on the table next to this note. We had no time to spare so we've
    only took a short break before resuming the search. There are multiples constructions
    such as mansions, houses and sheds spread throughout the forest, make sure to
    search all of them thoroughly since there might be clues or items that could
    help you later on. Our next destination is a mansion on the top of the hill,
    I'll make sure to call and keep you updated with everything going on. Mansion
