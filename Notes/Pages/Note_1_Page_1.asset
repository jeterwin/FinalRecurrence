  text: "\tTwo years ago today, 13th May 1999, there was a disastrous sight to be
    seen on Rosebud Avenue, where three children, Steven Brook, Charley Rolland and
    Elias Otto, all went missing from the same area. The police found out that the
    first victim, Steven Brook, was kidnapped at midnight while Elias and Charley
    went missing in the morning. They were unsupervised and there were no witnesses
    at the scene, the neighbours had claimed to have been away from home at that
    moment. The kidnapper was very careful not to leave any clues behind, making
    the search a hidrance for the police."
